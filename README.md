# canvas-move-in-grid
learning by doing, lets try make joystick and move inside canvas

update.
joystick is made, and also canvas save as png file in browsers default downloads page.
next i think should hide and show certain buttons, according to gameplay.
make some div tags and put buttons inside and show/hide the divs according to gameplay.
should make all pieces and make an object variable for each to track their location.
should make coordinates included in the chessBoard() function.
feel a little bit confused in a big number of functions inside js file.
